Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity

This module is dedicated to the Quixotic quest of determining whether "P=NP".
It attempts to decide whether a given Graph::Undirected contains a Hamiltonian Cycle,
using a series of polynomial time tests.

The input graph is systematically simplified and traversed, in a series of recursive tests.
The underlying algorithm is non-deterministic.
