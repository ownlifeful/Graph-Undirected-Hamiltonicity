=head1 NAME

Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity::Output - convenience subroutines for
printing output in various formats.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01


=head1 SYNOPSIS

The output() subroutine examines an environment variable called
HC_OUTPUT_FORMAT to determine the output format. The output format
can be one of:

=over 4

=item * 'html' : output in HTML form, with graphs embedded as inline SVG.

=item * 'text' : output in text form, with graphs converted to edge-lists.

=item * 'none' : do no generate any output.

=back

    use Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity::Output;

    output("Foo<BR/>");
    # in html mode, say "Foo<BR/>"
    # in text mode, say "Foo"
    # in none mode, print nothing.

    output($g); # $g is a Graph::Undirected
    # in html mode, print the SVG to draw this graph
    # in text mode, print the adjacency-list of this graph
    # in none mode, print nothing.


    output($g, { required => 1 });
    # Indicates that the graph should be formatted
    # as a graph of "required" edges only.


=head1 EXPORT

Exports the output() subroutine by default.

=head1 SUBROUTINES


=head2 output

This subroutine produces output polymorphically, based on the state of the
HC_OUTPUT_FORMAT environment variable, and on the input.

It is overloaded to output literal HTML, text stripped from HTML, and
SVG embedded inline.
