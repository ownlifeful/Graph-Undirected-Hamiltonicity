=head1 NAME

Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity::Spoof - spoof undirected graphs.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity::Spoof qw(&spoof_known_hamiltonian_graph);

    my $v = 30;
    my $e = 50;
    my $g = spoof_known_hamiltonian_graph($v,$e);

    ### $g is an instance of Graph::Undirected
    ### $g is a random Hamiltonian graph with $v vertices and $e edges.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 spoof_canonical_hamiltonian_graph

Takes: $v, the number of vertices desired.

Returns: a Graph::Undirected with $v vertices, and $v edges.
         This graph is not random, but the canonical,
         ( regular-polygon-shaped ) Hamiltonian Cycle.




=head2 spoof_known_hamiltonian_graph

Spoof a randomized Hamiltonian graph with the specified number of vertices
and edges.

Takes: $v, the number of vertices desired.
       $e, the number of edges desired. ( optional )

Returns: a Graph::Undirected with $v vertices, and $e edges.
         This graph is random, and Hamiltonian.
