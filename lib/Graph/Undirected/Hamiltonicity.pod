Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity - decide whether a given Graph::Undirected
    contains a Hamiltonian Cycle.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01


=head1 SYNOPSIS


This module decides whether a given Graph::Undirected contains
a Hamiltonian Cycle.

    use Graph::Undirected;
    use Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity;

    # Create and initialize an undirected graph.
    my $g = Graph::Undirected->new( vertices => [ 0..3 ] );
    $g->add_edge(0,1);
    $g->add_edge(0,3);
    $g->add_edge(1,2);
    $g->add_edge(1,3);

    if ( graph_is_hamiltonian( $g ) ) {
        say "The graph contains a Hamiltonian Cycle.";
    } else {
        say "The graph does not contain a Hamiltonian Cycle.";
    }

=head1 EXPORT

This module exports only one subroutine -- graph_is_hamiltonian()

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 graph_is_hamiltonian

Takes a Graph::Undirected object.

Returns 1 if the graph contains a Hamiltonian Cycle,
        0 otherwise.
